 Developed a Weather Clone App that provides real-time weather updates for any location.
 Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app features a responsive design that adapts seamlessly across devices. By integrating a weather API, the app dynamically displays current conditions, offering an intuitive and user-friendly experience. 
 This project allowed me to enhance my front-end development skills while applying JavaScript to create interactive and functional web applications.
